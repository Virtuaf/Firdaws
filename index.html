        <div class="firstdiv"><h1>FILIB: the future of reading</h1>
        <p>FILIB stands for FIction LIBrary. To create this app we had to answer the question, How do we organize books?<br>
            Organizing books digitally and physically permits two different initiatives when they have the same requirements<br>
            Thats why we created a digital library that helps you sort your books by theme, genre, author, length, popularity, fondness etc.<br>
            depending on your desires you can customize your shelf to look like it would in reality.</p><br>
            <p>Click Apply, to be part of the first hundred clients to test run this app<b>!</b></p></div>

        <h2>Get to know Firdaws</h2>
        <p>To be able to assess someone, you have to know the person and I'm offering you the the chance to get into my mind.<br>
           Currently reading bad blood by jennifer lynn barnes so ignore the obviously formal and official unertone of this<br>
            document.
        </p>
            <p>First of all: <br> <strong>I'll write you a poem</strong><br>
                <p>You convince yourself<br>
                you're unique, different<br>
                telltale signs that you are better than you seem<br>
                everyone else sees what you are on the ouside<br>
                you look for what you are on the inside<br>
                because you need to be different<br>
                you need to believe that everything you've done<br>
                was because that was you,<br>
                <em>the real you.</em></p>
